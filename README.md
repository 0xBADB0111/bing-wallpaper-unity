# bing-wallpaper-unity
Small bash script for changing wallpaper to the bing background.


#### Requirements
* libxml2-utils
* unity
* bash ;)

Should also work with GNOME Shell, but not tested. Tweet me if it works (@sernick_)

#### Installation

You can use it as cron hourly/daily/whatever, add to /etc/init.d/ or whatever,
but I suggest to add it to ~/.profile, for executing on login for current
user only.

* Download this script
* Put it somewhere
* Change RES variable to your screen resolution (not all resolutions work)
* Change chmod on this file to 755 (or just add execution flag)
* Open ~/.profile and add path to this file on the bottom
* Relogin to your account
* ?????
* PROFIT

Enjoy
