# bing-wallpaper-unity
Small bash script for changing wallpaper to the bing background.


#### Requirements
* libxml2-utils
* unity
* bash ;)

Should also work with GNOME Shell, but not tested. Tweet me if it works (@sernick_)

#### Installation

You can use it as cron hourly/daily/whatever, add to /etc/init.d/ or whatever,
but I suggest to add it "the ubuntu way":

* Download this script
* Put it somewhere
* Change RES variable to your screen resolution (not all resolutions work)
* Change chmod on this file to 755 (or just add execution flag)
* Do as shown here http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/32599/auto-running-bash-script-on-login/32616#32616
* Relogin to your account
* ?????
* PROFIT

Enjoy
